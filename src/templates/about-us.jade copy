							h2 Why MetroMed Urgent Care?
							p We realize that patients with non-threatening illness or injuries can be treated just as well and with the same diagnostic testing that hospital emergency departments provide, but without the chaos and long waits associated with traditional ER visits. Fees at Leesburg Urgent Care are also almost half of those charged by hospital emergency rooms.
							p If your doctor is not available to see you when you have an acute illness, you will find that Leesburg Urgent Care's fees are similar to those charged by primary care practices.
							p Because they specialize in emergency medicine, Leesburg Urgent Care's doctors have established relationships with other local medical practices and will be happy to refer you to other practices for chronic or preventative care.
						
						div
							h2 What to expect
							p We are here to help take care of the many of non-life-threatening emergencies that are common among adults and children of all ages (including infants). We do our best to keep the paperwork to a minimum so that you can get on with getting better.
							p You will need to complete two forms: a registration form and financial agreement. Please bring your photo ID and insurance card with you.
							p We participate with most major insurance plans. Please ask for more information.
							p If you need care after a motor vehicle accident, we will ask you to pay for services at the time of your visit. We will provide you with all the necessary documentation you will need to submit a claim to your insurance company.
							p If you need care for a worker's compensation injury, we will work with your employer to ensure your claim is completed properly to expedite processing.
							p Employers are invited to contact us to set up accounts for their employees.
